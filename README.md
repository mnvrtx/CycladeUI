**Objective**
To make working with UI interfaces convenient and fast. Adding a new screen to the project should take as little time as possible.

**Implementation**
There are 2 libraries in the repository: **CycladeUI** and **CycladeBindings**.

**CycladeUI**
This library is designed for working with screens and popups. All work with UI interfaces is done using the PopupSystem class. Open the project in Unity and run the scene Assets/Scenes/ExampleScene.unity to see examples of working with popups. The code for the examples is in the script attached to the "Controller" GameObject inside this scene.

Settings are located in the ScriptableObjects folder.

**CycladeBindings**
This library is intended for automatically setting references in MonoBehaviour. For example, open the prefab Assets/Resources/ExampleShop.prefab.
